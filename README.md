# BDSx Script Loader
#### Custom Script Loader for Bedrock Dedicated Server extended.
- - - -

After personally using BDSx and joining the discord community, I wanted to expand its functionality to match the current server I operate. But some of the community had got there first. 

So as I wanted to utilise said scripts, I adopted my code to suit the community and to respect other mod loaders/injectors. One of the better known mod Loaders is Element Zero. To honor EZ, Script Loader will check for new scripts and identify if they follow a markup to auto populate the ***custom.yml*** file, which again is a homage to Element Zero. 
### Q. How do I enable a script?
*To enabled a script via the loader, you will need to either download a script which has been adapted for the loader, or you can adopt a script to work with the Script Loader.*

**Markup for Script Loader**
```
// ScriptLoader | START
// Option: OptionName: true|false
// ScriptLoader | END
```
